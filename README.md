# Berry-Picker
Pick berries to order earning points for fulfill orders quickly but careful not to damage the berries. Move the container closer to the trees, risk some time running back or risk damaging the fruit, choose your strategy.Â 

Initially this project started as a prototype for a job position I then went back and added more berries and trees. I implemented a new scoring system and a level system with increasing difficulty.
